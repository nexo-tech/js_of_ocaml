(* Tests for closure variable capture and hoisting
   Validates that the Lua generator correctly handles:
   - Simple closures with captured variables
   - Nested closures
   - Forward references (closure before variable assignment)
   - Sibling closures sharing parent variables
   - Atomic references in closures *)
