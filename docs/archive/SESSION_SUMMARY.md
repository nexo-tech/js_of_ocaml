# Session Summary - Task 5.3k Printf Float Format
**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: MAJOR PROGRESS - Dispatch infrastructure complete, control flow issue remains

## Completed This Session

### ✅ Task 5.3k.1 - Dispatch Infrastructure (COMPLETE)
**Problem**: 6 blocks missing dispatch cases causing infinite loops
**Solution**: Two fixes to block collection:
1. Don't exclude switch cases from continuation (they can be both)
2. Collect from true branch terminator (references continuation blocks)

**Result**: All 246 blocks now have dispatch cases, Printf %d/%s work correctly

**Commits**: `16ba19a3`, `53bcbb81`, `7d9ce9f9`

### ⏳ Task 5.3k.2 - Control Flow (IN PROGRESS)
**Problem**: Printf %f hangs in infinite loop between blocks 572↔573
**Root Cause**: Switch statement runs EVERY while iteration, overwrites `_next_block`

**Attempted Fixes**:
1. Remove `_next_block = -1` from loop - DIDN'T FIX (commit `dfd16135`)
2. Guard switch with `if _next_block == nil` - IMPLEMENTED, TESTING (commit `27e51405`)

**Current Status**: Guard implemented, %d/%s still work, %f behavior changed (need trace to verify)

## Key Discoveries

### Discovery 1: Blocks DO Exist
Initial analysis (Tasks 5.3a-j) incorrectly concluded blocks 594-602 don't exist.
Reality: They exist and are switch cases. Collection logic was just skipping them.

### Discovery 2: Switch Cases Can Be Continuation Blocks
Block 383 is BOTH switch case 22/24 AND continuation target from block 314's Cond.
Must not exclude switch cases from continuation dispatch.

### Discovery 3: True Branch Needs Collection
True branch terminator (block 593) may reference continuation blocks (246, 248).
Must seed collection from true_addr, not just switch_cases.

### Discovery 4: Fix #3 (Break) Breaks Working Code
Adding `break` to empty continuation list caused %d to hang.
Empty list is correct when all blocks handled by tag dispatch.

### Discovery 5: Infinite Loop 572↔573
Traced execution: blocks 572 and 573 alternate forever.
Root cause: Switch runs every iteration, resets `_next_block`.

### Discovery 6: Guard Switch Execution
Switch should only run when `_next_block == nil` (first iteration).
On continuation iterations, skip switch and go directly to continuation dispatch.

## Test Results

| Format | Before Session | After 5.3k.1 | After Guard |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| %d     | ✅ Works      | ✅ Works     | ✅ Works    |
| %s     | ✅ Works      | ✅ Works     | ✅ Works    |
| %f     | ❌ Hangs      | ❌ Hangs     | ⏳ Testing  |

**Investigation** (8 commits):
- `3c9b4c85` - Test fixes
- `e2d7c829` - Debug infrastructure
- `fc9f7db0`, `cc3300f6`, `e0078264` - Root cause docs
- `11757e37` - Compilation bug fix
- `995e249c` - Partial dispatch fix
- `26da1b2e` - Next steps

**Regression & Bisection** (3 commits):
- `3b7c77c4` - WIP with regression (reverted)
- `16ba19a3` - Final dispatch fix (Fix #1 + #2)
- `53bcbb81`, `7d9ce9f9` - Documentation

**Control Flow** (3 commits):
- `b535b839` - Loop 572↔573 identified
- `dfd16135` - Remove _next_block=-1 (didn't fix)
- `27e51405` - Add switch guard (testing)

## Next Steps

1. **Trace new generated code** to verify guard prevents 572↔573 loop
2. **If still hangs**: Check if continuation dispatch structure is correct
3. **If progresses but hangs elsewhere**: Likely needs float formatter runtime
4. **Update XPLAN.md** when Task 5.3k.2 complete

## Files Modified

- `compiler/bin-lua_of_ocaml/compile.ml` - Compilation fix
- `compiler/lib-lua/lua_generate.ml` - Dispatch fixes, guard implementation
- `XPLAN.md` - Task 5.3k.1 marked complete

- `TASK_5_3K_SUMMARY.md` - Investigation timeline
- `TASK_5_3K_FINAL.md` - Task 5.3k.1 complete summary
- `TASK_5_3K_REGRESSION.md` - Bisection analysis

## Time Spent

Approximately 6-8 hours across multiple sessions:
- Root cause investigation: 3-4 hours
- Dispatch infrastructure fix: 2-3 hours
- Control flow debugging: 1-2 hours

## Key Learnings

1. **Bisect systematically**: Testing fixes individually revealed Fix #3 broke working code
2. **Trace execution**: Adding Lua traces identified exact loop pattern
3. **Match JS patterns**: JS uses labeled break, Lua needs equivalent (guard condition)
4. **Initial assumptions can be wrong**: Blocks existed, just weren't collected properly
